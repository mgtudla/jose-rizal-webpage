                            <h3 class="mb-4"> A Biographical Sketch of Dr. Jose Rizal</h3>

                            <p><strong>Jose Rizal, the national hero of the Philippines and pride of the Malayan race, was born on June 19, 1861, in the town of Calamba, Laguna. He was the seventh child in a family of 11 children (2 boys and 9 girls). 
                                Both his parents were educated and belonged to distinguished families.
                            </strong></p>

                            <p>
                                His father, Francisco Mercado Rizal, an industrious farmer whom Rizal called "a model of fathers," came from Biñan, Laguna; while his mother, Teodora Alonzo y Quintos, a highly cultured and accomplished woman whom Rizal called "loving and prudent mother," was born in Meisic, Sta. Cruz, Manila. At the age of 3, 
                                he learned the alphabet from his mother; at 5, while learning to read and write, he already showed inclinations to be an artist. He astounded his family and relatives by his pencil drawings and sketches and by his moldings of clay. At the age 8, he wrote a Tagalog poem, "Sa Aking Mga Kabata," the theme of which revolves on the love of one’s language. In 1877, at the age of 16, he obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree with an average of "excellent" from the Ateneo Municipal de Manila. In the same year, he enrolled in Philosophy and Letters at the University of Santo Tomas, 
                                while at the same time took courses leading to the degree of surveyor and expert assessor at the Ateneo.

                                <br>
                                 He finished the latter course on March 21, 1877 and 
                                passed the Surveyor’s examination on May 21, 1878; but because of his age, 17, he was not granted license to practice the profession until December 30, 1881. In 1878, he enrolled in medicine at the University of Santo Tomas but had to stop in his studies when he felt that the Filipino students were being discriminated upon by their Dominican tutors. On May 3, 1882, he sailed for Spain where he continued his studies at the Universidad Central de Madrid. On June 21, 1884, 
                                at the age of 23, he was conferred the degree of Licentiate in Medicine and on June 19,1885, at the age of 24,
                                 he finished his course in Philosophy and Letters with a grade of "excellent."
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Having traveled extensively in Europe, America and Asia, he mastered 22 languages. 
                                    These include Arabic, Catalan, Chinese, English, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Malayan, Portuguese, Russian, Sanskrit, Spanish, Tagalog, and other native dialects.
                                     A versatile genius, he was an architect, artists, businessman, cartoonist, educator, economist, ethnologist, scientific farmer, historian, inventor, journalist, linguist, musician, mythologist, nationalist, naturalist, novelist, opthalmic surgeon, poet, propagandist, 
                                     psychologist, scientist, sculptor, sociologist, and theologian."

                            <p> He was an expert swordsman and a good shot. In the hope of securing political and social reforms for his country and at the same time educate his countrymen, 
                                Rizal, the greatest apostle of Filipino nationalism, published, while in Europe, several works with highly nationalistic and revolutionary tendencies. 
                                
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                In March 1887, his daring book, NOLI ME TANGERE, a satirical novel exposing the arrogance and despotism of the Spanish clergy, 
                                was published in Berlin; in 1890 he reprinted in Paris, Morga’s SUCCESSOS DE LAS ISLAS FILIPINAS with his annotations to prove that the Filipinos had a civilization worthy to be proud of even long before the Spaniards set foot on Philippine soil; on September 18, 1891, EL FILIBUSTERISMO, 
                                his second novel and a sequel to the NOLI and more revolutionary and tragic than the latter, was printed in Ghent. Because of his fearless exposures of the injustices committed by the civil and clerical officials, Rizal provoked the animosity of those in power. This led himself, his relatives and countrymen into trouble with the Spanish officials of the country.
                                
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                As a consequence, he and those who had contacts with him, were shadowed; the authorities were not only finding faults but even fabricating charges to pin him down. Thus, he was imprisoned in Fort Santiago from July 6, 1892 to July 15, 1892 on a charge that anti-friar pamphlets were found in the luggage of his sister Lucia who arrive with him from Hong Kong. While a political exile in Dapitan, he engaged in agriculture, fishing and business; he maintained and operated a hospital; he conducted classes- 
                                taught his pupils the English and Spanish languages, the arts. </p>
                            
                                <p> There was a also a time when Rizal was able to draw a bird flying nearby without lifting the pencil he was using from the paper till the picture he drew was finished.
                                     He can also draw a running horse and a chasing dog. Clay and wax were the favorite play materials of Rizal. He used these materials in forming modeled birds and butterflies.
                                     This animal molding activity also started his study of nature.</p>



                         <p>Jose Rizal also owned a pony and used it to have long rides into the surrounding country which was rich in scenery. 
                            He also took long walks together with his big black dog named Usman. He also loved to play with the doves in his neighborhood. 
                            He learned about the myths and legends in Laguna after sleeping through the nut in a little straw hut used by Laguna farmers during the harvest season. 
                            Rizal was also good in hand tricks which he perfected to amaze the simple folk and performed magic lantern exhibitions.</p>

                        <p>Even in his childhood, Rizal already knew how to respect the rights of others and requested his elders to reason with him rather than get mad at him for small offenses.
                             He became a welcome companion for adults even at his young age since he respected their moods and was never a hindrance to their activities. </p>
